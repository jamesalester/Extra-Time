# Extra Time [Stremio](https://www.stremio.com/) Addon

Watch goals and highlights from the latest football matches from around the world.

This add-on's probably not coming at the best time considering sport has basically been cancelled world-wide due to the Corona virus but hopefully once we're all back to normal this will be useful for footie lovers.
